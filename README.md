<!--Description  -->
## Description
Django can be (and has been) used to build almost any type of website â€” from content management systems and wikis, through to social networks and news sites. It can work with any client-side framework, and can deliver content in almost any format (including HTML, RSS feeds, JSON, and XML).

Internally, while it provides choices for almost any functionality you might want (e.g. several popular databases, templating engines, etc.), it can also be extended to use other components if needed.
Django web applications typically group the code that handles each of these steps into separate files:

There are four main table used in the project auth_user, Shifts , UserDetails and the PaymentStatus.<br>
The auth_user table is used to store the username, credentails ,Lastlogin, etc information.<br>
The Shifts table is used to store the sessions avaliable to do the yoga. They can be dynamically handled if any change is required in the table.<br>
The UserDetails Table contains details of the reqistered user and the PaymentStatus table stores the latest payment status of each month.<br>
The main functions are written in views.py. The models.py hold tables as classes.

## Note:- The relations of the table is upload in the repo as:-https://github.com/abhi2404/fm_yoga_backend/blob/master/ERD_fm.pdf
